{"name":"TicTacToe Board","google":"","tagline":"TicTacToe on the ATMega32","body":"### About\r\nThis code is designed to run on the TicTacToe board ( available for purchase soon ) powered by the ATMega32.\r\n### Flashing onto the chip\r\nThe build script included in the project uses avrdude to flash a hex file onto the ATMega32. It has been tested with a Sparkfun Pocket AVR programmer, and should work with any USBTiny based programmer. Other types of programmers can be used, however the build script will need to be changed to tell avrdude to use the programmer.\r\n### Porting to other chips\r\nThis code should work on similar AVR processors with the proper modifications to build.sh. If you would like to run this on some other micro`controller, you would need to rewrite the TicTacToeIO class to access the I/O pins on your chip.\r\n### Dependencies \r\nUbuntu packages:\r\n+ avrdude\r\n+ gcc-avr\r\n+ libc-avr\r\n\r\nOn a Mac, [Crosspack](http://www.obdev.at/products/crosspack/index.html) has everything you need.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
